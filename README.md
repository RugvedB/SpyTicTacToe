# SpyTicTacToe

This App can be used to read all the incoming sms(on the phone in which it is installed) and send sender's number and message body to the server where it can be stored or used according to the need.

And also it can be used to play tic-tac-toe :p

## About Server
* I have hosted <strong>flask server</strong> using ngrok.
* For the app to be working host it on ngrok and change variable <strong>ngrokID</strong> in MainActivity.java file to your ngrok ID.
